![Alt text](images/logo.png)

This project constitutes a presentation of the different components
that CML provides for Data teams to be able to do MLOps using cloudera CDP

This project will installs a theoretically flight delay predictor machine learning lineal model. It will use:
* sessions
* jobs
* experiments
* models
* applications

# Project setup and walkthrough

1. Create internal dependecies (folder structure for deploying models)
2.
